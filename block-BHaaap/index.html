            <P>Rajgir, meaning the abode of Gods, is a town in Nalanda district about 93 km southeast of Patna. It finds mention in the Mahabharata as the kingdom of Jarasandha, the arch nemesis of Krishna and his Yadava clan. While the exact date of Rajgir’s foundation is not known, the city is believed to be about 3000 years old. Rajgir is divided into two parts: one which is fortified and surrounded by seven hills and the other, which is believed to have been founded by King Bimbisara’s son, Ajatshatru. There are two local beliefs about the name of the town. One belief is that the town gets its name from the Hindi word rajgriha which means royal house and the other states that the name comes from the rajgir (also a Hindi word), which means royal mountain.</P></div>
